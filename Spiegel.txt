OUTLINE:
I.   Elementary Probability Theory (p. 139 - 171)
  A. Definitions of Probability (p. 139 - 140)
    1.  Classic Definition (p. 139)
      i.   The probability of an occurrence of an event (called its success) $p = Pr\{E\} = \frac{h}{n}$; where $h$ is the number of ways the event can occur and $n$ is the total possible equally likely ways.
      ii.  The probability of nonoccurrence of the event (called its failure) is denoted $q = Pr\{not E\} = \frac{n-h}{n} = 1 - \frac{h}{n} = 1 - p = 1 - Pr\{E\}$.
      iii. Thus $p + q = 1$, or $Pr\{E\} + Pr\{not E\} = 1$. The event "not E" is sometimes deonted by $\hat{E}$ or $~E$.
    2. Relative-Frequency Definition (p. 140)
      i.   The estimated probability, or empirical probability, of an event is taken to be the relative frequency of occurrence of the event when the number of observations is very large.
      ii.  The probability itself is the limit of the relative frequency as the number of observations increases indefinitely.
  B. Conditional Probability: Independent and dependent events
